Enable Stole Device Protection: With Stolen Device Protection, some features and actions have additional security requirements when your iPhone is away from familiar locations such as home or work. These requirements help prevent someone who has stolen your iPhone and knows your passcode from making critical changes to your account or device.
To enable Stolen Device Protection on an iPhone, go to Settings, tap Face ID & Passcode (or Touch ID & Passcode), enter your passcode, and then tap Stolen Device Protection to turn it on. You can choose to have this security feature apply only when away from familiar locations or to have it always active, regardless of location
